#Full Stack Web Development Diploma

This diploma course takes the student from the basics of designing a web page to the ability to develop web applications using the technologies most in demand in the industry. Currently this means developing web apps using Node, ExpressJS, Angular, React and MongoDB but this will change over time. For this reason we recommend a curriculum reevaluation every 4 semesters (2 sessions).

The curriculum is divided into 3 phases and the contents of each phase will be presented in a manner that provides the student a wholistic view of the development process. This means that the content outlined below will be presented in a manner which is less linear that this outline would suggest (e.g. [HTML](#html) and [CSS](#css) and [the Browser](#the-browser) will be presented concurrently in the first week with [javascript DOM scripting](#javascript-i) being folded into the discussion in week three). The class outlines and projects reflect this.
